I am currently a Master's student at **Columbia University** in their Management Science and Engineering program, with over 2 years of work experience in both a product manager as well as a technical developer role. My professional experience includes working as a **Product Manager** at Paytm (#1 Mobile Payments App in India) and prior to that working in one of the most competitive industries as a **Quantitative Researcher** at Trexquant Investments (Hedge Fund). I **love building things** from scratch and hence have a steep inclination towards Product Management and my interests lie broadly in the areas of Advertising Technology (AdTech), Artificial Intelligence and Cloud Computing. 

Apart from these I like to indulge in creative artforms, such as painting, sketching, and more recently abstract photography. You can find more details and some of my interesting works in the sections below.
