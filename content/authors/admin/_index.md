I completed my undergraduate studies from the Department of Mechanical Engineering at **Indian Institute of Technology Madras**. I am currently working as a **Product Manager** at Paytm (#1 Mobile Payments App in India) in India.
My interests lie broadly in the area of **Artificial Intelligence** and **High Performance Computing**. I have worked on several projects involving a mix of concepts such as Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. You can find my projects in the sections below. 

I have completed several industrial internships during my undergraduate education of which a few are a Summer Internship at AB-InBev, the world's largest brewer, and as a Global Alpha Researcher at Trexquant.
