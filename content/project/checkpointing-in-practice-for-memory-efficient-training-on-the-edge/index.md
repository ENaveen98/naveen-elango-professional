* The research involved developing a novel and systematic method to enable the training of Deep Neural Networks such as ResNet, MobileNet, VGG, DenseNet, etc. on memory-constrained Edge devices.
* Performed experiments with training Deep Neural Networks in devices with 1GB RAM and was successfully able to run such Architectures in a Raspberry Pi Board, which was otherwise not possible.
* Optimized training of MobileNet and ResNet-18 architectures and thereby reduced memory consumption by a factor of 2.6 and 1.8 respectively without loss in predictive power.
