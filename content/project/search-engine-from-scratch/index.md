In this project I build a Search Engine from Scratch using First Principles to gain a deeper understanding of the Fundamental concepts in Natural Language Processing.

I also use this opportunity to write a report in a rather unconventional way where I place emphasis on the questions rather than the actual answers! This is in an effort to replicate my thought process and the strategies I followed while working on this project.

* Designed an Information Retrieval System from scratch using first principles in Natural Language Processing.
* Implemented vector space models to embed texts and optimized the system using the PageRank Algorithm to retrieve Documents based on a query given by the user.
